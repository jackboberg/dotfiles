description: "Review code changes, a plan, a live page (running dev server), or a local HTML file with crit inline comments. Use when asked to review code, a plan, a diff, a running web app, or when you want structured human feedback on your work. Also covers programmatic comment authoring, crit share/unpublish, GitHub PR sync, and review file interpretation."

## What I do

- Launch Crit for a plan file, the current git diff, a live page (URL to a running dev server or staging site), or a local HTML file.
- Wait for the user to review changes in the browser.
- Read the review file and address unresolved inline comments.
- Signal the next review round with `crit` when edits are done.
- Leave inline review comments programmatically with `crit comment`.
- Sync reviews with GitHub PRs via `crit pull` and `crit push`.

## When to use me

Use this when the user asks to review a plan, spec, code changes, a live page (running dev server, staging URL), or a local HTML file in Crit, when project instructions require a Crit pass before accepting non-trivial changes, when leaving inline comments on code, or when syncing reviews with GitHub PRs.

## Launching `crit`

The CLI auto-detects the review mode from its arguments. **Do not ask the user which mode to use.** Pass arguments through:

```
crit <arguments>               # file, dir, URL, .html — CLI auto-detects mode
crit --pr <num|url>            # GitHub PR (range mode)
crit --range <base>..<head>    # commit range (range mode)
crit                           # no args → branch diff
```
If no arguments, check conversation context:

1. A plan file was written earlier in this conversation → `crit <plan-file>`
2. Otherwise → bare `crit` (branch diff)

## Review file format

Comments have three scopes:

- **Line comments** (`scope: "line"`) — tied to specific lines, stored in `files.<path>.comments`
- **File comments** (`scope: "file"`) — about a file overall, stored in `files.<path>.comments` with `start_line: 0`
- **Review comments** (`scope: "review"`) — general feedback, stored in the top-level `review_comments` array

The review file path is shown by `crit status`.

```json
{
  "review_comments": [
    {
      "id": "r_f1e2d3",
      "body": "Overall the architecture looks good",
      "scope": "review",
      "author": "User Name",
      "resolved": false,
      "replies": [
        { "id": "rp_b4a5c6", "body": "Thanks, addressed the minor issues", "author": "OpenCode" }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "files": {
    "path/to/file.go": {
      "comments": [
        {
          "id": "c_a1b2c3",
          "start_line": 5,
          "end_line": 10,
          "body": "Comment text",
          "quote": "the specific words selected",
          "anchor": "The sessions table needs a complete rewrite...",
          "author": "User Name",
          "resolved": false,
          "replies": [
            { "id": "rp_c7d8e9", "body": "Fixed by extracting to helper", "author": "OpenCode" }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Field rules:
- `resolved`: `false` or **missing** — both mean unresolved. Only `true` means resolved.
- `quote` (optional): the specific text the reviewer selected — narrows scope within the line range. Focus changes on the quoted text rather than the entire range.
- `anchor` (line comments): full text of the commented lines when placed. When edits shift line numbers, locate content by anchor rather than trusting `start_line`/`end_line`.
- `drifted: true`: original content was removed or heavily rewritten — line numbers are approximate at best.
- Before acting on a comment, check `replies` — if you've already replied, the reviewer may be following up rather than requesting a new change.

## Authoring and replying with `crit comment`

```bash
# Review-level (general feedback)
crit comment --author 'OpenCode' '<body>'

# File-level (whole file, no line numbers)
crit comment --author 'OpenCode' <path> '<body>'

# Line (single line or range)
crit comment --author 'OpenCode' <path>:<line> '<body>'
crit comment --author 'OpenCode' <path>:<start>-<end> '<body>'

# Reply to an existing comment
crit comment --reply-to <id> --author 'OpenCode' '<body>'
```

Hard rules:
- **Always pass `--author 'OpenCode'`** so comments are attributed correctly.
- **Always single-quote the body** — double quotes break on backticks and shell metachars.
- **Line numbers reference the file on disk** (1-indexed), not diff line numbers.
- **Reply bodies support markdown** — use code fences and inline code where helpful.
- **Only pass `--resolve` when the user explicitly asks.** Never resolve proactively.

## Bulk commenting with `--json`

When leaving 3+ comments, use `--json` for atomicity (single write, no partial state) and speed (one process). The JSON can come from stdin or `--file <path>`:

```bash
# stdin works for short, single-line bodies:
echo '[
  {"body": "overall feedback", "scope": "review"},
  {"path": "session.go", "body": "restructure", "scope": "file"},
  {"file": "src/auth.go", "line": 42, "body": "Missing null check"},
  {"file": "src/auth.go", "line": "50-55", "body": "Extract to helper"},
  {"reply_to": "c_a1b2c3", "body": "Fixed — added null check"},
  {"reply_to": "r_f1e2d3", "body": "Done"}
]' | crit comment --json --author 'OpenCode'
```

**Prefer `--file <path>` when any body spans multiple paragraphs.** A raw newline inside a JSON `"body"` string is invalid, and shell-quoted heredocs make that easy to introduce by accident. Write the JSON to a temp file, then:

```bash
cat > /tmp/crit-bulk.json <<'EOF'
[
  {"file": "src/auth.go", "line": 42, "body": "Para 1.\n\nPara 2."}
]
EOF
crit comment --json --file /tmp/crit-bulk.json --author 'OpenCode'
```

`--file -` is shorthand for stdin.

Per-entry schema:

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `file` / `path` | string | line/file comments | Relative path. `path` alone (no `line`) → file-level. |
| `line` | int/string | line comments | `42` or `"45-47"` |
| `end_line` | int | optional | Defaults to `line` |
| `body` | string | always | |
| `author` | string | optional | Per-entry override; falls back to `--author` |
| `scope` | string | optional | `"review"` / `"file"` — usually inferred |
| `reply_to` | string | replies | Comment ID (`c_…` or `r_…`) |
| `resolve` | bool | optional | Only when user explicitly asks |

Scope inference (when `scope` omitted): has `reply_to` → reply; no `file`/`path` and no `line` → review-level; `path` but no `line` → file-level; `file`/`path` + `line` → line.

## Multi-file disambiguation

If `crit comment` errors with "comment found in multiple files", IDs collided across files. Disambiguate with `--path`:

```bash
crit comment --reply-to c_a1b2c3 --path src/auth.go --author 'OpenCode' 'Fixed the null check'
```

In `--json` mode, set the `file` field on the entry. Review-level IDs (`r_…`) are globally unique and never need this.

## Plan-mode comments

Plan reviews (via `crit plan` or the ExitPlanMode hook) store the review file in `~/.crit/plans/<slug>/`. **Always pass `--plan <slug>`** — without it, `crit comment` looks in the project root and won't find the comments. The slug is shown in the review feedback prompt.

```bash
crit comment --plan my-plan-2026-03-23 --reply-to c_a1b2c3 --author 'OpenCode' 'Updated the plan'
```

## GitHub PR sync

```bash
crit pull [pr-number]                                    # Fetch PR review comments into the review file
crit push [--dry-run] [--event <type>] [-m <msg>] [pr]   # Post review comments as a GitHub PR review
```

Requires `gh` CLI installed and authenticated. PR number is auto-detected from the current branch.

`--event` values: `comment` (default), `approve`, `request-changes`. `-m` adds a review-level body message.

## Guardrails

- Do not continue past the review step until the user confirms they are done.
- Treat the review file as the source of truth for line references and comment status.
- If there are no unresolved comments, tell the user no changes were requested and stop.
